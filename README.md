Employee_Attrition
==============================

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data obtained from the Human Resources Department of IBM, determine the factors that influence employees to leave IBM, and build a prediction model to predict which employees will become attrition. 

This project will help IBM’s HR Department and employers by providing an in-depth analysis as to identify what types of employees are choosing to leave, and determining which employees are at risk to leave next. Predicting employee attrition before it happens will allow organization employers and managers to develop strategies to minimize employee attrition rates and motivate employees to stay in their jobs. This project can also help determine the underlying factors and insights important for employee retention.
